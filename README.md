**Frequently Asked Questions**
---
**Q: Can I use this mod in my modpack?**

A: Of course, just credit me (by linking to this page).

**Q: Is this mod available in version X.Y.Z?**

A: Maybe. I will try to support as many past versions as is reasonable (>=1.17) and update this mod for future versions if possible. If you want the mod for a version that is not yet available, just open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/the-sh4d0w/myth-and-magic/issues).

**Q: Will this mod work in already existing worlds?**

A: Somewhat. The worthiness tasks are completed upon advancement unlocking, which will not happen if you already have them. You will have to use the `/excalibur updateTasks <player>` command to check for already completed advancements. And excalibur will only be generated in new chunks.
